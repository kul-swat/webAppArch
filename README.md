Single Tier system- All the services stays in 1 m/c
Adv:
data transfer withing m/c so easily and quickly. data Safer . less n/w latency as no n/w is req.
real performance depends on how powerful m/c is and software hardw/r req
Disadv:
less secure as every1 has auth to use every service.
once the code is pushed it cannot be stopped as once ui is pshed and the stop can't be done.
